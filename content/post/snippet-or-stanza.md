How do you manage your code snippets or stanzas?

I recently found a software called [SniBox](https://snibox.github.io/), Previously I was using a OneNote Notebook connected to my 365 Env. so that I could access it from anywhere, However as I started to fill that notebook up with more and more snippets it became hard to find things, it was as organized as it could be but still not organized enough so I set off to find something else that would give me more features like tagging, search, code coloring/formatting, etc... so I found SniBox in my search for something that was Self Hosted, FOSS, Ran in Docker.



I have not moved all of my snippets into SniBox yet but I have gotten my most used ones into it and the search and tagging is great! No more digging through pages and pages of snippets in OneNote

Check out SniBox using the link below!
